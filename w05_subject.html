    <h3>Rhythms</h3>

      In order to read music, we must first understand the duration of different kinds of notes.
      A whole note has a duration of 4 beats.

An eighth note has a duration of 1/2 of a beat. 8 eighth notes are equal to one whole note. 
When reading music with eighth notes, we can subdivide the beats in half. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4, we can count 1-and 2-and 3-and 4-and, whereas each "and" represents an eighth note.

    Lastly, a sixteenth note has a duration of 1/4 of a beat. Therefore, 4 eighth notes are equal to one beat. 
    When reading music with sixteenth notes, we can subdivide the beats in fourths. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4, we can count 1-e-and-a 2-e-and-a 3-e-and-a 4-e-and-a, whereas each "e," "and," and "a" represents a sixteenth note.
