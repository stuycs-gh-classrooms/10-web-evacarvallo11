    <h3>Rhythms</h3>
    <p>
      In order to read music, we must first understand the duration of different kinds of notes.
      A whole note has a duration of 4 beats.

A half note has a duration of 2 beats.

A quarter note has a duration of 1 beat.

An eighth note has a duration of 1/2 of a beat. 
When reading music with eighth notes, we can subdivide the beats in half. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4, we can count 1-and 2-and 3-and 4-and, whereas each "and" represents an eighth note.

    A sixteenth note has a duration of 1/4 of a beat. 
    When reading music with sixteenth notes, we can subdivide the beats into fourths. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4, we can count 1-e-and-a 2-e-and-a 3-e-and-a 4-e-and-a, whereas each "e," "and," and "a" represents a sixteenth note.

    Lastly, in order to successfully understand rhythms, you must understand time signatures. In sheet music, you will notice a bunch of vertical lines that divide bar lines into measures.
      Time signatures define the amount and type of notes that each measure contains. You will notice that there are two numbers. The top number describes how many notes are in a measure.
      The bottom number tells you which type of note gets one beat. Most commonly you will be in 4/4 time, meaning that there are four notes in a measure, and the quarter note gets the beat.
      In time signatures like 6/8, however, there are six notes in a measure, and the eighth note is worth one beat.

    <h3>Note Names</h3>
    <p>
      Just like time signatures, there is another symbol on the music staff that appears at the beginning of each line (system) of measures. This symbol is called a clef. 
      There are many types of clefs, but the most common ones are the treble clef and the bass clef. These clefs determine the note names of the lines and spaces of each measure.
      They also determine how low or high the note is. In fact, the treble clef is also called the soprano clef because it is associated with soprano singers, the highest range of the voice, 
      while the bass clef is associated with bass singers, the lowest range for singers. 
      First we will look at the Treble clef.

    <p>
      Each of the lines and spaces of the bar lines has a note name. On the treble clef, the notes on the lines are: E – G – B – D – F. You can use the mnemonic Every Good Boy Does Fine to remember these notes.

      The notes for the spaces are F - A - C - E. You can use the mnemonic FACE to remember these notes.

    <p>
    On the bass clef, the notes on the lines are: G - B - D - F - A. You can use the mnemonic Grizzly Bears Don't Fear Anything to remember these notes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The notes in the spaces are A - C - E - G. You can use the mnemonic All Cows Eat Grass to remember these notes.

    Lastly, when looking at sheet music, you might notice that some notes are not on or between one of the five lines in a measure. These notes have their own lines called ledger lines. These notes are just an extension of the regular staff. 
      To find the note names for notes with ledger lines, you can simply count up or down from a note you already know using the pattern of notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B.

  <h4> Steps and Accidentals </h4>
    <p> In music, we measure the space between notes based on half and whole steps. A half step is the distance between one key on a piano to the adjacent key. 
      A whole step is the same distance as two half steps.
      An accidental is a symbol used to raise or lower the pitch of a note.
      A flat lowers the pitch of a note by a half step. 
      A sharp raises the pitch of a note by a half step.
    </p>

    <p>
      While most of the notes we already learned are a whole step away from each other on the piano, the distance between E-F and B-C is only a half step.
      This means that E sharp is the same as F, and B sharp is the same as C. 
      In addition, since we can sharp and flat all notes, there are other equivalent notes as well. For example, G sharp is the same as A flat.
