<h2> Steps and Accidentals </h2>
    <p> In music, we measure the space between notes based on half and whole steps. A half step is the distance between one key on a piano to the adjacent key. 
      A whole step is the same distance as two half steps.
      An accidental is a symbol used to raise or lower the pitch of a note.
      A flat lowers the pitch of a note by a half step. 
      A sharp raises the pitch of a note by a half step.

      While most of the notes we already learned are a whole step away from each other on the piano, the distance between E-F and B-C is only a half step.
      This means that E sharp is the same as F, and B sharp is the same as C. 
      In addition, since we can sharp and flat all notes, there are other equivalent notes as well. For example, G sharp is the same as A flat.
