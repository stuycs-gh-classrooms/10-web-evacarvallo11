      What is music theory?

      scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, etc.

      Why is Music Theory important?
    </p>
    <p>
      Music Theory is important because it enables us to understand the structure and meaning behind a musical composition.
      As well, if you play and instrument, I am sure you know just how complicated "musician language" is. 
      Don't you want to join in on the fun?
