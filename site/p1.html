<h3>Note Names</h3>
    <p>
      Just like time signatures, there is another symbol on the music staff that appears at the beginning of each line (system) of measures. This symbol is called a clef. 
      There are many types of clefs, but the most common ones are the treble clef and the bass clef. These clefs determine the note names of the lines and spaces of each measure.
      They also determine how low or high the note is. In fact, the treble clef is also called the soprano clef because it is associated with soprano singers, the highest range of the voice, 
      while the bass clef is associated with bass singers, the lowest range for singers. 
      First we will look at the Treble clef.

      Each of the lines and spaces of the bar lines has a note name. On the treble clef, the notes on the lines are: E – G – B – D – F. You can use the mnemonic Every Good Boy Does Fine to remember these notes.

    Lastly, when looking at sheet music, you might notice that some notes are not on or between one of the five lines in a measure. These notes have their own lines called ledger lines. These notes are just an extension of the regular staff. 
      To find the note names for notes with ledger lines, you can simply count up or down from a note you already know using the pattern of notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B.
